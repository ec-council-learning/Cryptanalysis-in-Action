<p>Cryptanalysis in Action, by EC-Council<br>
</t>Emre Caglar Hosgor, Author</p>

# Structure of the Course Repository
Setting up the environment<br>
Section 2 Fundamentals of Cryptography and Terminology<br>
Section 3 Cryptographic Algorithms, including historical ciphers<br>
Section 4 Fundamentals of Cryptanalysis and Terminology<br>
Section 5 Cryptanalysis, Attacks Against Ciphers<br>

# Requirements
This repository is a supporting material for the course content.<br>
You can test the Jupyter notebooks in a Windows environment with Anaconda installed.<br>
Visual Studio Code is preferred. Notebooks are just supporting material, a starting point for building complex cryptanalysis applications.<br>
<br>
We hope this helps your cybersecurity journey.

<em>Note:</em> While running Asymmetric Cryptography examples public and private keys stored in the directory. You can delete them no to attract attention of the scanners. Because that creates a private key spillage which we don't want.
