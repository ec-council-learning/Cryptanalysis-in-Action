    "Lattice-based cryptography is designed to make these steps computationally difficult, ensuring the security of encryption schemes based on lattice problems.

    "A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack in the context of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) is an attack where an adversary intercepts communication between two parties (e.g., a client and a server) and can potentially eavesdrop on or manipulate the data being exchanged.

    "In this pseudo-code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The attacker intercepts the initial client_hello and server_hello messages during the SSL/TLS handshake, which initiates the secure connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The attacker impersonates the client and crafts a modified client_hello message to initiate a connection with the server, pretending to be the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The server responds, believing it is communicating with the client, and the attacker intercepts this response.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The attacker forwards the server's response to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The client and server continue with the handshake, establishing an encrypted connection. During this phase, the attacker may intercept and manipulate data between the client and server.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Once the MitM attack is successful, the attacker can eavesdrop on the data being exchanged or even modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "MitM attacks on SSL/TLS are dangerous because they can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of secure communications. To prevent MitM attacks, SSL/TLS implementations employ techniques like certificate validation and secure key exchange protocols to ensure the authenticity of the parties involved in the communication. Additionally, the use of public key infrastructure (PKI) and proper certificate management helps establish trust in SSL/TLS connections."
