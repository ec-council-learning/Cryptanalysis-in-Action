    "<strong>Recap:</strong> Symmetric KE = KD But Symmetric KE ≠ KD<br>\n",
    "You can think of symmetric encryption as using the same number in an equation. If you multiply a number by X, you get an answer (which you can think of as the ciphertext). To get the number back, you use the inverse operation, division, with the same number X. So 15 times 3 equals 45. To get back to 15, you just divide by 3.<br><br>\n",

    "With asymmetric encryption, it isn’t so conceptually clean, to begin with. You apply one number to encrypt the input, and you apply another number to decrypt. The inverse-ness (if that is a word) is built into the keys themselves.<br>\n",
