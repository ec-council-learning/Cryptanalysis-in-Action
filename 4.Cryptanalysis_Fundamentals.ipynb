    "<li><em>1400 BC:</em> The first known cipher, the Atbash cipher, is developed in ancient Egypt.</li>\n",
    "<li><em>800 BC:</em> Al-Kindi’s Frequency Analysis for monoalphabetic substitution ciphers.</li>\n",
    "<li><em>400 BC:</em> The first known cryptanalysis text, The Scytale, is written by the Greek mathematician Polybius.</li>\n",
    "<li><em>15th century:</em> The Vigenère cipher is developed in France.</li>\n",
    "<li><em>19th century:</em> The first mechanical cipher machines, such as the Enigma machine, are developed. Bletchley Park’s Crack Team Alan Turing and his team cracked the Enigma code combination.</li>\n",
    "<li><em>20th century:</em> The first computers are developed, which lead to a revolution in cryptanalysis. A machine called “Deep Crack” used brute force attack that tried one million DES keys every microsecond and in a few hours tested every possible key and broke the DES algorithm.</li>\n",
